# A-Star-Pathfinding-cSharp

Current System: 
  Uses a static List<string> to represent the map
  Uses Custom Node class for when looping through the map
  Uses Custom Vector class for storing location of each Node


Plans:
- Make it so it can read map from file
- Make it so it shows Checked and Path at end on one map
- Make better UI and in-map editor
